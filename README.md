# Fine-tuning-Stable-diffusion
This repository belongs to the process of augmenting, collecting data, and fine-tuning the stable diffusion. This repository provides the code to fine-tune stable diffusion version 1.4 using Lora and the original versions of the 1.4 stable diffusion. The result of running this code is to fine-tune the moded resulting in a loss less than 0.00083.
# Datase
This repository uses the available dataset in hugging face and it is available through in alirezzaa13/Mechanicalpart. The number of available mechanical samples is 7.36 K images.
The process of augmenting the picture are: 

1. HSI Contrasting.
2. Normalization.
3. Zooming aspect.
